## [Firefox-AlphŒ±](#features) üóø Super clear desktop browser

<img src="assets/fire-alpha-adapt.gif" alt="firefox alpha preview animation adaptive colors" width="720" height="auto"/>

Fast and minimal Firefox configuration with zero buttons, for simplicity and intuitive gesture controls. 

In reality, this is a fork of VVV

https://github.com/KiKaraage/Firefox-Alphaz
But i have also added some things that in my opinion make it better


Things such as having simpleMenuWizard (fixes context menus and tabs) in the chrome folder already installed

Or simple things like adding the "Save image as..." button, i was surprised to see it not be there in the first place.


This is the theme I've used for some time now. It would make you motivated to close unneeded tabs, or live with 4+ row of tabs lol.

### What's the same...
- It's still **clean**. No window control buttons.
- **Multi-row Tabs** and **Multi-row Bookmarks** is still here.
- **Find bar** still look like tab bar too. **Menu bar** still looks clean.
- **Download** button is still on the same progress pill bar.
- **Click twice on tab bar's empty area to add New Tab** is still supported.
- You can still use Firefox theme addons with it, even better with extensions like Chameleon or Adaptive Tab Bar Color.

### What's different...
- **URLbar & Navigation bar is now separated from the tab bar.** 
Some Firefox updates around March made it unfunctional - you can't click to edit your URLbar and it's only accessible via keyboard shortcuts. I decided to scrap the combined bar altogether, and.....
- **I make the Navigation bar overlapping half of the last tab bar row.**
Yeah. Where else should I move the much needed navbar, especially in multi-row tabs hahaha. But don't worry, the navbar is almost empty and won't change the way tabs looks heavily - I just had to slightly increase inline and top padding surrounding the tabs.
- There's two buttons now on right side of the Navigation bar, both hidden by default, shown on hover:
    - Extension button. You can't use shortcut to trigger this menu manually so I had to show it on the navbar.
    - Show URL Bar button. Thanks to MrOtherGuy, the whole URLbar can be hidden and shown as a single button.
    - I bring my Popup Search css from ArcWTF. I just love this mechanism so much and use it on all of my Firefox instance, even Zen. (I forgot where did I took the original code: ShyFox? Shina-Fox?)

## Multi-row Tabs

<img src="assets/tabs.png" alt="firefox alpha multi-row tabs" width="520" height="auto"/>

Stacking tabs into multiple rows enhances tabs access, simplifies navigation, and optimizes screen space for efficient multitasking and improved user experience:

## Multi-row Bookmarks

<img src="assets/bookmarks.png" alt="firefox alpha multi-row bookmarks" width="520" height="auto"/>

Bookmarks are now organized in multiple rows below the Tabs, improving accessibility and resource management, especially for users with a large number of bookmarks:

Set `Bookmarks Toolbar` > `Show only on New Tab` to display Bookmarks only on New Tab;

Add `History` / `Downloads` to Bookmarks Panel for quick access;

Add `ü•é Emojis` to folder names instead of useless folder icons for better visual identification.



&nbsp;


## New Clean Menu

<img src="assets/menu.png" alt="firefox alpha new simple clean menu" width="520" height="auto"/>

New consistent Main Menu design, with clear and uniform UI, ensures efficient access to key features. Unnecessary elements are removed to simplify the layout and navigation:

### Search suggestions in URL bar are disabled intentionally for several reasons:

In some of my UX research, I found interesting results indicating that **disabling search suggestions** in the URL bar can **reduce cognitive load and help maintain focus.**

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Smiling%20Face%20with%20Sunglasses.png" alt="Smiling Face with Sunglasses" width="25" height="25" align="top"/> **`Productivity boost by lowering distractions and cognitive load`**

Disabling search suggestions cultivates a sense of control, reducing distractions and improving satisfaction. Users can concentrate on their tasks, boosting efficiency and search accuracy. This minimalist approach is especially helpful for users who find constant suggestions overwhelming, thereby enhancing the overall UX.

> **Search suggestions are still available on search engine webpage.**  
> Sometimes, search engine provides **[grammatically wrong suggestions](https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/56300495/sometimes-google-search-gives-me-grammatically-wrong-suggestions?hl=en)** (check google community forums for more info)

Suggestions are often based on the user's browsing history, frequently visited websites, and search patterns. Consequently, this personal data can be vulnerable, leading to privacy violations or badly targeted advertising. Users may also feel uncomfortable with the notion that their search behavior is being tracked and used for commercial or other purposes without their explicit consent.

### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Face%20in%20Clouds.png" alt="Face in Clouds" width="25" height="25" align="top"/> **`Echo chambers`**

The reliance on personalized suggestions may result in the formation of echo chambers, limiting users' exposure to diverse perspectives and information. This can potentially reinforce existing biases and restrict the exploration of alternative viewpoints.

> **In other words, the user gains significantly improved search results by correctly formulating the search query themselves, rather than relying on suggestions.**
